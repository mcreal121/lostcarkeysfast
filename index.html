If you lose all your car keys and are locked out it typically costs $400 to $1200 to open the door and make one new key. It is cheaper if the door is unlocked but I will still have to remove and decode your lock cylinder in most cases. Please call me before you lose your keys so I can make you a backup copy. Most car insurance and roadside assistance plans will reimburse you the first $100 if you lose your keys or are locked out of your car. Contact me for an estimate.
